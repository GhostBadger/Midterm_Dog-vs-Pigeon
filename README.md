# ConflictMidterm_DogVsPigeon
I love dogs. But tesla here claims that pigeons are much superior and says that the pigeons are his true friends. So we are making a site to settle this debate in a weird html off?

The site contains two main paragraphs and an image supplied too.

Tesla: supports pigeons and will be stating all of the reasons that pigeons are better than dogs. I will follow up with a personal picture of myself and a pigeon that I truly cared for. Of course until a wild probably rabies infected mangey dog with little dignity covered in mud and feces ate it.

# Project Description
This is just a site Tesla and I, Georgey Kurien are using to settle a debate whether dogs are better than pigeons or vice versa. This may get ugly.

# Installation
Copy the git repository to preferred project location. After that, do anything you want!
